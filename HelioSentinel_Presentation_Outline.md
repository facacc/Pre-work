---

**Slide 1: Title**
- **HelioSentinel: AI-Powered Solar Microgrids with Least-Cost Electrification Planning**
- [Your Team Name + Member Names]
- *One-line summary*: “Delivering resilient, affordable energy to underserved communities through AI and solar microgrids.”

---

**Slide 2: Problem Statement**
- Millions in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa lack reliable, affordable electricity.  
- Frequent blackouts and poor grid infrastructure threaten essential services—healthcare, education, businesses—especially in rural and disaster-prone areas.  
- Marginalized groups suffer most, deepening inequality and slowing development.  
- Traditional grid expansion is slow and costly, missing communities in greatest need.
- *Add a relevant image*: e.g., map of Nigeria/Africa, rural clinic, or blackout scene.

---

**Slide 3: Solution Overview**
- **Key Features:**
  - AI-powered, modular solar microgrid platform
  - Real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance
  - Least-Cost Electrification Planning tool (geospatial + economic modeling)
  - Mobile dashboard and SMS alerts for easy management
  - Scalable from a single clinic to entire villages
- *Add visual*: System diagram or icons representing solar, AI, IoT, dashboard, SMS.

---

**Slide 4: How It Works / System Architecture**
- **Components:**
  - Solar panels & battery storage
  - IoT sensors for real-time data
  - AI-powered controller for predictive maintenance
  - Mesh network for communication
  - Mobile dashboard for users
- *Add system architecture diagram*: Use AI-generated or draw.io.
- *Add 1-2 sentences* describing data/power flow.

---

**Slide 5: User Flow / Journey**
- **Steps:**
  1. Community assessment
  2. Least-cost electrification planning
  3. Installation of solar panels & batteries
  4. Connecting IoT sensors
  5. Monitoring via AI dashboard
  6. Receiving alerts via SMS
- *Add flowchart or arrow diagram*: (Use Google Slides shapes or AI image)

---

**Slide 6: Deployment Plan / Map**
- Show map with marked villages/clinics
- Highlight central monitoring/control
- *Visual*: Map with solar and battery icons at different sites, lines for network

---

**Slide 7: Dashboard & SMS Mockups**
- **Dashboard:**
  - Real-time energy usage
  - Battery levels
  - System health
  - Alerts
- **SMS Alert:**
  - Example: “Alert: Battery low at Clinic A. Please check system.”
- *Visuals*: Screenshots, wireframes, or AI-generated images

---

**Slide 8: Current Status & Next Steps**

  - Advanced prototype stage
  - System architecture and dashboard designs complete
  - AI logic tested on simulated data
  - Hardware sourced
- **Next Steps:**
  - Assemble and test hardware prototype
  - Integrate live sensor data
  - Validate planning tool
  - Field test SMS and mesh networking
  - Pilot deployment in rural clinic or school

---

**Slide 9: Team**
- Names + roles (Engineer, Data Scientist, Community Lead, Project Manager, etc.)
- *Add photos or icons for each member (optional, use placeholders if needed)*

---

**Slide 10: Call to Action / Contact**
- “We are seeking partners, feedback, and collaborators.”
